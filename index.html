Take for example the limited privacy options for class members: Dart only provides for private members where the boundary of privacy is the library.</p><p>While private members can get you a long way, often, what you are really looking for is a protected member, i.e. a private member that is still visible to sub-classes even if they are defined in <em>different</em> libraries.</p><p>I guess, the canonical example is a UI framework offering e.g. a Button class. When extending the base class to create your own FancyButton, access to &#39;private&#39; implementation details is often required. Lack of protected access forces you to expose the implementation through public members.</p><p>Thankfully, there is a simple workaround. I will demonstrate with an example, leveraging the above-mentioned UI framework scenario. Let&#39;s start by defining a base Button class:</p><pre><code>library ui.button;

// &#39;Public&#39; API
abstract class Button {
  factory Button({HtmlElement host}) = ButtonImpl; // Redirecting constructor
  void click();
}

// &#39;Protected&#39; implementation
abstract class ButtonImpl implements Button {
  ButtonImpl({this.host});

  int state = 0; // &#39;protected&#39; implementation detail.

  @override
  void click() {
    this.state = 1;
    host.classes.add(&#39;selected&#39;);
  }
}
</code></pre><p>In your application, namespaced in another library, you define a custom button:</p><pre><code>library my.app.fancy_button; // notice, this is another library

abstract class FancyButton extends Button {
  factory FancyButton({String title, HtmlElement host}) = FancyButtonImpl;
}

class FancyButtonImpl extends ButtonImpl implements FancyButton {
  String title; // voila, a protected property

  ButtonImpl({this.title, HtmlElement host}) : super(host: host);
}
</code></pre><p>You can use it like this:</p><pre><code>final button = new FancyButton(title: &quot;Cancel&quot;, host: element);

button.title // =&gt; cannot access!
button.state // =&gt; cannot access!
</code></pre><p>You cannot access the &#39;protected&#39; members of FancyButton (or even Button&#39;s protected members, for that matter). As an added bonus, if you would like to side-step the protection (e.g. you are writing a unit-test and you would like to assert some implementation details) you can just instantiate the implementation class:</p><pre><code>final button = new FancyButtonImpl(title: &quot;Cancel&quot;, host: element);

expect(button.title, equals(&quot;Cancel&quot;)); // =&gt; true
</code></pre><p>While this workaround is relatively straightforward, I really hope Dart&#39;s designers will introduce a @protected annotation in the future. An annotation that is statically asserted (e.g. by the IDE or dart-analyzer) would be an elegant and practical solution.</p></article></section><hr><section><article><header><h1><a href=/posts/2014/10/03/cool-retro-terminal.html>Cool retro terminal</a></h1><span class=date>2014-10-03</span></header><p>I dig command line terminals, I dig retro computing, I dig cool stuff.

It &#39;s easy to tackle the horizontal axis using CSS:</p><pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
.hcenter {
  margin: auto;
  width: 320px;
  height: 240px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hcenter&quot;&gt;Horizontally centered text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><p>On the contrary, I thought that CSS can&#39;t handle vertical centering (at least in a cross-browser compatible way) and a quick Google session ended fruitless as well. Instead, I wrote a small script to programmatically center the div inside the window. It took a couple of revisions to support resizing, eliminate flickering, ensure cross-browser compatibility, etc. but eventually I got it right.</p><p>Today though, I re-discovered an old trick:</p><pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
.center {
  position: absolute;
  width: 320px;
  height: 240px;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  margin-top: -120px;
  margin-left: -160px;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Horizontal and vertical centered text is possible.&lt;/div&gt;

It seemed too good to be true. A robust client-side JavaScript toolkit and UI framework was just what I missed in my stack.</p><p>I quickly downloaded the distribution and, like the rest of the world, was immediately disappointed: The source looked like Java, with long name spaces and getters/setters everywhere. The compiler looked interesting but difficult to setup and integrate in the build process. The templating engine looked ugly and required a compile step. I switched back to jQuery faster than you can say &#39;crap&#39;.</p><p>The problem is I wasn&#39;t fond of jQuery either. It &#39;s great for improving the interactivity of a page or adding special effects but leaves a lot to be desired when you are building a business-oriented Web application. As I am working on a series of Web applications for deployment through Google Apps Marketplace I decided to give Closure a second chance.</p><p>I followed a couple of online tutorials, browsed through the online API reference and the thoroughly commented source code and experimented with some demo apps. Eventually, the concepts of Closure started to sink in. But still, I had like hundreds of questions.</p><p>That&#39;s when I decided to buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fss%5Fi%5F0%5F10%26fsc%3D14%26ih%3D12%5F1%5F0%5F1%5F0%5F1%5F0%5F1%5F0%5F1.70%5F207%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dclosure%2520the%2520definitive%2520guide%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3DClosure%2520th&amp;tag=httpwwwreizuc-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Closure, the definitive guide</a> book, available as a Rough Cut from O&#39;Reilly. What a great book! The <a href="http://blog.bolinfest.com/">author</a> painstakingly discuses the design rationale behind the Closure tools and exposes the benefits of the suite. The Closure library is genetically engineered to work with the Closure compiler and the Google developers behind it are really obsessed with performance, memory consuption, compatibility and code safety/debugability. The whole system is optimized for bigger development teams, not quick Web page hacks.</p><p>Among other things, I learned that:</p><ul><li>the powerful type system eliminates a large class of bugs</li><li>the compiler eliminates the long name spaces (and the corresponding run-time look ups)</li><li>getters/setters actually lead to better compression</li><li>you can split the client side code in multiple, independently loaded modules</li><li>the pseudoclassical pattern used for OOP is actually better than the functional pattern (when combined with the Closure compiler)</li><li>you can easily extend the Compiler with extra features...</li></ul><p>...and so much more. I don&#39;t want to spoil your fun, just grab this great book. It&#39;s the only way to really get into Closure. Heck, I would recommend this book even if you are not interested in Closure, it will make you a better JavaScript programmer.</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, no tool is really perfect. Closure still has some issues: no CommonJS compatibility (but then again, CommonJS seems kind of dead these days), limited support from Google (they seem to be pushing GWT instead) and a shallow community around the project. Still, Closure suits my needs better than other solutions.</p><p>The verdict?

Everything started with CommonJS: the emerging standard spawned an ecosystem of compatible implementations competing against each other while advancing the JavaScript state of the art.</p><p>Then, NodeJS happened: An async only JavaScript platform, powered by V8, not really interested in CommonJS conformance. RY (the new DHH) managed to grab the attention of the developer community with cool marketing, leaving other implementations in the shadows. One such great implementation that deserves more attention is RingoJS.</p><p>Some time ago I switched from Narwhal to Ringo and never looked back. I strongly believe that Ringo is the preeminent CommonJS implementation. Here is why:</p><ul><li>Ringo is quite possibly the most conformant CommonJS implementation, certainly more conformant than Narwhal and Node.</li><li>Ringo is <em>fast</em>. If you tried Narwhal/Rhino and found start up times lacking or module reloading unacceptably slow check out Ringo! You will be pleasantly surprised. And while v8 may be faster than Rhino, the JVM is still quite optimized for server side environments. (And btw, in a modern Web application, time spent running the server side script is a negligible percentage of the total request/response cycle. You should probably work on optimizing network issues, database interactions, client side rendering, etc).</li><li>Ringo is mature, stable and crash free. Ringo is the evolution of Helma, one of the first server side JavaScript platforms (more than 10 years in development). It&#39;s also based on the mature Java platform. Contrast this to reports of NodeJS crashes.</li><li>Access to the gazillion of Java libraries. There is no merit in reinventing the wheel, just reuse code from the Java ecosystem. The integration between Java and JavaScript is seamless.</li><li>Windows compatibility. OK, Windows sucks, but still, a lot of engineers use Windows as a development platform. Ringo apps work on Windows out of the box.</li><li>Support for synchronous and asynchronous APIs. Use what&#39;s best for your application.</li><li>Thanks to AppengineJS you can run your Ringo applications on Google&#39;s scalable infrastructure.</li><li>The lead developer is extremely talented and friendly.</li><li>Stop drinking the Kool-Aid!
