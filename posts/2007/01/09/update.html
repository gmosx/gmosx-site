The functional programming style is well suited for building scalable distributed applications. Moreover, Haskell is so different than other languages that it makes me feel excited. Haven&#39;t had such fun since I first experimented with Ruby.</p></li><li><p>At last, I resolved my ADSL problems and I have a proper Internet connection at home. If you are a Greek reader here is my current opinion on <a href=http://www.tellas.gr>Tellas</a>: The call center is difficult to reach, but the support team is knowledgeable and the actual Internet Connection seems quite speedy. Not many years ago <a href=http://www.ntua.gr>NTUA</a> was served by a single 2 Mbps connection, and now I have a 4Mbps connection in my bed room!</p></li><li><p>I downloaded the Wii Internet Channel. This works great, easily surpassing my expectations. For example cull.gr works like a charm. Every day, as I get more comfortable with the Wii interface I more and more admire the excellent work Nintendo&#39;s engineers have done on this system. Wii can really make the world of Games and Internet accessible to non-technical people. Hey, even my mother tried (and liked!!) Wii Tennis.</p></li><li><p>I prepared a new homepage, I am sure you can guess my inspiration.</p></li></ol><p>I am considering a number of web site ideas for the Greek market while actively working on infrastructure code and processes. I am also looking for potential investors, so if you feel like it you can contact me.</p><footer><div class=labels><span>Programming</span> <span>Life</span> <span>Gadgets</span></div></footer></article></section><section class=discussion><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>
