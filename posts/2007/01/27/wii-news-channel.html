I closed all the lights and while I was opening the door, I noticed my Wii glowing blue in the dark. &#39;Strange&#39;, I said while opening my TV. Some seconds later I was reading Nintendo&#39;s note in the Message Center. <a href=http://gizmodo.com/231654/first-nintendo-wii-news-channel-tour-and-screenshots>The Wii News Channel was ready for download</a>. I was really curious so I closed the door and pressed the download button (oh, I love using the Wiimote as a pointer). A minute or so later, I was browsing the new interface.</p><p>It is just great! The ability to &#39;grab&#39; the globe with the Wiimote and zoom into each country and see what&#39;s happening is just great. The news items themselves are quite lengthy and informative as well. They are provided by AP. I especially like the Slide-show feature: you can just lay on your sofa and watch random news on a rotating earth.</p><p>I really think that it is a shame that Wii (and DS) is a product of Nintendo. This lovely piece of hardware has so many possibilities, and I am not sure Nintendo is the right &#39;parent&#39; for such a prodigy. More about this in a future post.</p><footer><div class=labels><span>Gadgets</span></div></footer></article></section><section class=discussion><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>
